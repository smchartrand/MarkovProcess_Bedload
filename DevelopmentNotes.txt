Questions and criticisms:

1. Even though we specify a narrow range of grain sizes, we end up with some pretty small grains
(< 1 mm) on the bed surface. These relatively small grains are entrained regardless of position
on the bed surface in relation to larger grains. Are we okay with that? Specifically, we assume
that relatively large mobility thresholds are overcome under our rarefied simulations. 
ADDRESSED: We have narrowed the grain size distribution for the range ~ 3-6 mm.

2. If we narrow the grain size distribution too much, e.g. 4-6 mm, the current method of building the random bed gets hung up from 90-100% completion looking for available positions on the bed. We may need to change how grains are randomly placed, moving to more of a brute force method where x,y coordinates are incrementally adjusted from the initial random position. The present model build kicks things back to the random coordinate generator.

Topic: Grain placement at/near avaialble vertex [i.e. open vertex]
1. At available vertex, query whether the two bounding fixed grain tops are at the same elevation.
Yes: do nothing, grain can be placed in the vertex position as long as there is enough spotlight space given other bounding grains.
No: then we use our 2D sphere placement algorithm to guide the way:
a) Calculate difference of the radius for grain 1 or grain 2 [whichever is higher] and the placed grain radius.
b) The difference represents the cosine length of a right triagle placed at the bottom of placed grain.
c) project

Questions and criticisms:
1. Even though we specify a narrow range of grain sizes, we end up with some pretty small grains
(< 1 mm) on the bed surface. These relatively small grains are entrained regardless of position
on the bed surface in relation to larger grains. Are we okay with that? Specifically, we assume
that relatively large mobility thresholds are overcome under our rarefied simulations.
2.
